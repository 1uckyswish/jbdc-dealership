# Advanced Java Car Dealership with MySQL Integration

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Advanced Java Car Dealership project! This project is aimed at streamlining the management of a car dealership through a Java-based application. With the recent integration of MySQL, the application now offers enhanced data management capabilities and scalability.

## Project Setup

1. **Maven Project Initialization**:
   - Created a new Maven project in IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Added dependencies including MySQL Driver and `BasicDataSource` in the `pom.xml` file.

2. **Database Configuration**:
   - Installed and configured MySQL on my system.
   - Created a MySQL database named `CarDealership`.
   - Executed the provided database script to set up required tables (`vehicles`, `sales_contracts`, `lease_contracts`).

3. **Model Modifications**:
   - Modified existing models (Dealership, Vehicle, SalesContract, LeaseContract) to include an `id` field for database compatibility.

## Persistence Logic

- Replaced FileManager class with DataManager classes for CRUD operations interacting with MySQL.
- Organized DataManager or DAO classes for each database table (vehicles, sales_contracts, lease_contracts) for better modularity.

## Application Flow

- Ensured continuity in application flow from Workshop 5, now interacting with MySQL instead of CSV files.
- All functionalities on the dealership home screen fetch or update data from MySQL.

## Sale vs Lease

- Implemented logic to store sales contract data in `sales_contracts` table and lease contract data in `lease_contracts` table.

## Main Class (Home)

This is the heart of our Java Car Dealership project. The Main class manages all store functionalities. Check out the Maven Java folder structure on the left to see how the project is organized.
